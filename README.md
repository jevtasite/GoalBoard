# GoalBoard - Stadium Broadcast Pro

A professional football (soccer) scoreboard web application built with React. This application serves dual purposes on a single screen - as a projected display for spectators AND as an operator control interface.

## Features

### Scoreboard Display (Top Section)
- Large, broadcast-quality score display
- Team names with customizable labels
- Live match timer with period tracking
- Card indicators (yellow and red cards)
- Animated goal celebrations with light streaks
- LED board scan line effect
- Red card visual effects

### Control Panel (Bottom Section)
- **Team Controls** (both sides):
  - Score increment/decrement buttons
  - Team name editing
  - Yellow and red card tracking
  - Fouls and corners statistics

- **Match Controls** (center):
  - Timer with start/pause/reset
  - Period selector (First Half, Half Time, Second Half, Extra Time, Full Time)
  - Next match reset functionality
  - Fullscreen toggle
  - **Presentation Mode** - Hide controls for clean projection

### Presentation Mode ðŸŽ¥
Perfect for projection! Press `Tab` or click the "ðŸ“º Present" button to:
- Hide all operator controls
- Expand scoreboard to full screen
- Control everything via keyboard shortcuts
- Press `Tab` again to show controls

This solves the operator problem - you can control the scoreboard with keyboard shortcuts while spectators only see the clean scoreboard display!
